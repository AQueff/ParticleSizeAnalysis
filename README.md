# ParticleSizeAnalysis
## R scripts for transforming the raw data from our machine into a nice table, graphs and ternary plots. 
This need to be done first. This creates the nice csv with all data together. And then from this csv, I copy/paste some columns in another .csv which I give the example directly here: Distribution_for_decomposition_script.csv (I need to automatize that, not very hard for sure)

## R script for multimodal decomposition (co-created with Mathieu Bosq during his PhD, after we decided to stop using the Fityk software used in previous works during Luca Sitzia's PhD)
Uses the Distribution_for_decomposition_script.csv to make a list for all samples in the batch, and then you can play woth the multimodal decomposition, which is not easy!
